Hello! This is my first program in Javascript. It based on a New York Times Connections Game. 

To play, you choose matching sets of four words. You win the game when all of the sets are matched.
You have 4 chances to win, so guess carefully!

It doesn't have full functionality yet, and I hope to use my own words in the future, but enjoy.
